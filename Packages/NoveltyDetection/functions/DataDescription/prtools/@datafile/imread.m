%IMREAD Datafile overload
%
%     IM = IMREAD(A,N)
%
% The images (raw data) of the datafile A are returned as a cell array.
% The preprocessing and postprocessing defined for the datafile are
% skipped.
% If the index vector N is given, just these images are returned.
% In case a single image is requested, IM is not a cell array but double.
