# RunNNTrainCV

Run a Neural Network train (for novelty detection) with Cross Validation analysis and some initializations (number of init in $OUTPUTDATAPATH/TrainInformation.m)

# RunNNTrainCVAnalysis

Run a Neural Network train analysis (for novelty detection) with Cross Validation and choosing the best of initializations (higher SP value)
